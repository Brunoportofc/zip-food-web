- **Test Name:** Customer Registration and Login Success
- **Test Code:** [TC001_Customer_Registration_and_Login_Success.py](./TC001_Customer_Registration_and_Login_Success.py)
- **Test Error:** Test failed because the session persistence functionality is broken. After login, the session data is not maintained across page reloads or navigation, causing the user to be redirected back to the sign-in page. Additionally, untranslated text keys indicate a failure in localization loading or rendering.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b90dea66-7cdb-42af-855b-658e9c8f30e6/c37c2c5a-86ca-4db6-ba60-67c07c36a7c6
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** High
- **Analysis / Findings:** Session management is critically broken. Users cannot maintain authenticated state after page reload, breaking the core user experience. Localization system also fails to load proper translations.
